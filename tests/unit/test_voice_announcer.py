"""The refusal announcer, asserted on the DATA CHANNEL (Slice 1, branch-only).

**Why this file exists separately, and why it runs node.**

The acceptance criterion for "every refusal must speak" cannot be met by a
Python test that inspects a return value. A tool result carrying a perfect
reason string is *green in exactly the scenario the requirement exists to
prevent*: the client declines to create a response, nothing is generated, and
the owner hears silence while the test passes. That fixture shape is the whole
defect class here, so the subject under test has to be the events that reach the
channel.

The announcer is therefore exercised as itself — the same ``ANNOUNCER_JS``
string the page embeds, not a reimplementation — under node, against a fake
``send``/``speak``/timer. What is asserted is what was emitted.

The two properties that matter, and both are about things the client CANNOT
observe:

1. **``responseActive`` is induced, not assumed.** The silent branch fires when
   a response is already in flight, so the test puts the announcer in that state
   and asserts a ``response.create`` still reaches the channel.
2. **The ``speechSynthesis`` fallback is armed by a timer, not triggered by a
   detected failure.** ``responseActive`` is a client-side mirror and is stale
   by construction; ``send()`` is fire-and-forget. So the announcement can be
   dropped SERVER-side with the client's own state reporting success, and no
   failure-detecting design can catch that. The fallback must fire on a
   default-on timer that only positive evidence disarms — that is the case
   tested here, with every client-visible signal saying success.
